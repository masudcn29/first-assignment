            <p>It is been another demanding year for organisations in an environment beset by the pandemic, economic
                uncertainty
                and, more latterly, intensifying supply chain issues and disruption. If anything, 2021 has been just as
                tough as
                2020 was! Thinking back to this time last year, most of us were looking forward to getting out of 2020
                and
                hoping that 2021 would be a more normal year. And it seems likely that 2022 will not be straightforward
                either.

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>A vision and mission statement is a paragraph that encapsulates everything you would like to be, do, and
                have in your career. It defines what success and excellence look like to you. It expresses your vision
                for where you want to be in the future and it reflects your values, goals, and purpose and how you want
                to operate.</p>

            <h2>Vission</h2>
            <p>A vision statement describes what you want to achieve in the future.
                The vision statement answers the question “Where do I want to be?”
                It defines the optimal desired future state—the mental picture—of what you want to achieve over time,
                say in five, ten or more years.
                It inspires you to give your best and shapes your understanding of why you are doing what you do.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Life goals are all the things you want to accomplish in your life. Often your life goals are very
                meaningful to you and can make a lasting impact on your life. They can be large and challenging goals,
                or they can be smaller and more personal. It all depends on what you want to achieve.</p>

            <p>Creating Learning without Limits builds on the first Learning without Limits study by exploring the wider
                opportunities for enhancing the learning capacity of every child that become possible when a whole staff
                group works together to create an environment free from the limiting effects of ability labels and
                practices.</p>

            <p>Connecting to the global community fosters education, collaboration, and the birth of mutually-beneficial
                programs that make an impact. On the micro level, keeping oneself connected to the global community
                requires a conscious decision.</p>
